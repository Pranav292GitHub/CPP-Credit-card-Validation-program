# CPP-Credit-card-Validation-program
C++, one of the hardest languages(litterally what everyone thinks)  was what I was learning for the passed 6hrs and decided to use my knowledge and try to create this Credit Card Validator Program. It uses the Luhn Algorithm, to check whether the credit card given by the user is or not.
